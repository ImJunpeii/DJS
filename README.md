# **Discord JS Project With Command Handler & Cooldown Feature**

*This is a discord bot project with command handler and cooldown feature.
You can use this project for your own discord bot. I also added an example command of `Ping` and `Help` command.*

<br>

# **! Before You Fork !**
*You need to either add a `.env` file or add a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project and insert both prefix of your choice and your bot's token. **I hid the file because of course it's never safe to release your bot's token to the public. You would recieve consequences.***

***How would the .env File look like?***
```
TOKEN=TOKEN_HERE
PREFIX=PREFIX_HERE
```
*I'm not 100% sure if it has to **EXACTLY** look like this, but it works.*

## **ALSO!**
Make sure to install the `discord.js` package before you start the bot. You can do this by typing `npm i discord.js` in your terminal.
Here i'll list all important packages you need to install:
```
npm i discord.js node fs dotenv
```
